How to use:
 To use the compiler in a terminal write:
  compiler [input file path] [output file path]
 the output file path extension must be:
    *.c to generate C code or
    *.asm to generate NASM code
 otherwise it will throw an error and not compile the code

Operators:
 associativity is allways left to right
 the binary operator precedence are:
  +	0
  -	0
  %	1
  *	2
  /	2
  ^	3

Variables:
-Declaration:
 -Syntax:
   var_name : = expr ;
  You can not declare two variables with the same name

 You can not use a variable which has not been declared

-Assignment:
 -Syntax:
   var_name = expr;
 The variable must hav been declared to assign a value to it

Scopes:
 -Syntax:
   "{" + staments + "}"
  Scopes without staments are valid
 All the variables declared inside a scope will be delete when the scope ends
 Declaring a variable with the same name as another outside the scope is not allowed
 Scopes can be recursive
